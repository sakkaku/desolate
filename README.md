# Goals

- [x] Native Async (SynchronizationContext, etc)
- [x] Screw around with ECS
- [ ] Authoritative server first.
- [ ] Actually startup and render something.
- [ ] Visual editor to build out scenes / entities / etc.
- [ ] Visual Programming and conversion to compiled expression trees.
- [ ] Vulkan rendering with UI in a diff thread.
